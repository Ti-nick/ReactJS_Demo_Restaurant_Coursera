# Restaurant-Demo-Coursera

This is a Restaurant Reservation Website Demo that I have created while studying Frontend Developement on an online platform Coursera.

This Demo Website contains the following component or features:

1. A home page of a mock-up restuarent "Little Lemon".
2. A reservation page to record customers' bookings.

Skills learnt and used:

1. **UX/UI** on the website layout.
2. Using **flex-box** to arragne the elements such as navigation bar, week special cards and customers rating cards.
3. A **form** was built for the reservation page.
4. **Form validation** was implemented to ensure correct input.
5. **Retreiving avaliable reservation date from a mockAPI.js** file to the reservation form.
6. "react-router-dom" was used to **set routes** in the website.
7. "useState", "useReducer", "useEffect" were used to **handle user interaction** to the website.
