# Restaurant-Demo-Coursera

This is a **_React.js-based_** Restaurant Reservation Demo Website that I created while studying Frontend Development on Coursera. The project involved creating user personas, designing the UX/UI in Figma, and gradually building the website step by step.

This Demo Website includes the following components and features: 1. A home page for the mock restaurant “Little Lemon.” 2. A reservation page to record customer bookings.

Skills Learned and Applied:

1. **_UX/UI Design_** for website layout.
2. Using **_Flexbox to arrange elements_** such as the navigation bar, weekly special cards, and customer rating cards.
3. **_Building a form_** for the reservation page.
4. Implementing **_form validation_** to ensure correct user input.
5. **_Fetching_** available reservation dates from mockAPI.js and displaying them in the reservation form.
6. Using **_react-router-dom_** to define website routes.
7. Utilizing **_useState, useReducer, and useEffect_** to manage user interactions within the website.
